# PHP + Apache + Oracle OCI8 Extension in a Docker container
Docker container for Apache + PHP + Oracle OCI8 Extension

This installation make use of the very old 10.1.0.5 version of Instant Client package, because of a need to connect to a 10.1 Oracle database.

## Licensing
Maybe there's some problem to host Oracle packages in this repo. In this case I'll remove them and they will be available on official download site (https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html) (or search for "Instant Client Downloads for Linux").
